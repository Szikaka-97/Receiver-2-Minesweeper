# Minesweeper

## How to

Click out the number of mines and the play field size using panels. A minesweeper game will appear in the center of the room. After that you know the drill <br>

Flagging an already flagged tile will remove the flag <br>

Digging on a number tile with a number of flags around it matching the number of bombs around the tile will reveal all unflagged tiles around it <br>
